# LB-comp-challenge-2

For this challenge, I learned the wonders of flex-grow! I used flex properties to layout most of the site. I was especially
proud of the different logos that interchange for responsiveness. I chose the color palette to intentionally make the user
a bit uneasy. I hope you enjoy the Kate Bank.
